        "I chose this Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture specifically because my input data consists of static statistical summaries—the mean and variance of the MFCCs—rather than raw sequential audio. Since, I had already collapsed the temporal dimension during the preprocessing stage, utilizing complex recurrent or convolutional networks would have been computationally wasteful and unnecessary for this fixed-size feature vector.\n",

I also incorporated ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between these acoustic characteristics and biological age."
